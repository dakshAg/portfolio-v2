They all cheered as the race was about to begin,

The calm elephant, the naughty monkeys and the slightly infuriated robin.


The rabbit was excited, for it was an amazing track,

A flat, long road throughout the forest sounded like a life hack.


The tortoise's mixed feelings at the starting line were very real,

He could see his defeat coming soon, but he was in denial.


The trophy seemed too shiny, the prize was not one to let go.

And defeat would be embarrassing, unsure if he could take the blow.


The Rabbit had never felt fresher,

And the tortoise had succumbed to the pressure.


The race went on, the rabbit did its usual thing,

The tortoise, broken, tired, and exhausted, kept persisting.


Rabbit met his friends and explored the beautiful forest, but ran with grit.

The turtle could see nothing but the finish line and the barren road to it.


Rabbit saw the tears in the Tortoise's eyes, the desperation to win for once,

To prove he could do something, be proud and show he wasn't a dunce.


For the rabbit had seen a lot of victories, the trophy didn't matter,

Half faked a nap near the finish line to secretly watch the clatter.


The world remembered the legend of the outlier victory,

It'll always be a golden page in the forest's history.


Slow and steady wins the race became folklore,

But who do you think won more?
