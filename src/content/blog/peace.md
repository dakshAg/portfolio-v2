I don’t want no mellow fields,

No flowers, no fruits, no fulfilling yields.


It’s my passion to burn midnight oil,

To shoot with all my might and feel the recoil.


I don’t pray for silence, I don’t pray for calm,

I crave the battle, love the scars on my palm.


I’m a warrior, built for battles, built for glory,

To end each day with an unbelievable story.


May it be written in blood, carved in cold stone,

I made peace with the war zone.
