# Welcome to My Blog

Hello! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences with you through this blog. As someone who wears many hats - from founder to engineer to analyst - I have a lot to share about the intersection of technology, business, and human experience.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you'll find:

- **Technical deep dives** into the projects I'm working on
- **Entrepreneurial insights** from my journey building products
- **Data science explorations** and their real-world applications
- **Personal reflections** on life, learning, and growth

## My Journey So Far

With experience at companies like G7 Logistics and Square Peg, and a background in data science from the University of Melbourne, I've learned that the most interesting problems often lie at the boundaries between different disciplines.

Whether it's optimizing supply chain logistics, building recommendation systems, or exploring the latest in machine learning, I'm passionate about using technology to solve meaningful problems.

## Looking Forward

I'm looking forward to sharing more about:

- The technical challenges I've overcome
- The business lessons I've learned
- The personal growth experiences that shaped me
- My current projects and future plans

Stay tuned for more posts, and feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss any of these topics!
